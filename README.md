💻 Fullstack Frontend Developer | React | Next.js | TypeScript | Tailwind CSS

📈 Background in Finance | Fintech-focused



I’m a fullstack frontend developer passionate about building efficient, scalable, and user-centered digital solutions. I completed an intensive fullstack bootcamp where I worked on real-world projects that strengthened my skills in technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and other modern web development tools.

With a background in financial management, I bring an analytical, business-oriented perspective to my work, with a strong interest in fintech environments where I can contribute both technically and through a deep understanding of financial processes.

I’m known for learning quickly, adapting to new challenges, and thriving in collaborative environments. I’m currently seeking opportunities to grow professionally and continue adding value in dynamic, innovation-driven teams.
